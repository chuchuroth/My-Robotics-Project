This ensures the headlight’s electrical components are reliable, as highlighted in [How Consumer Reports Tests Car Headlights | Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/headlights/how-consumer-reports-tests-car-headlights/), which includes electrical assessments.

- **Crash Testing**: Simulates minor impacts to check for structural damage, ensuring the headlight can withstand minor collisions without failure. This is part of mechanical testing, as mentioned in [Robot arm for Mechanical testing | 6NAPSE Test Center](https://6-napse.com/en/technical-means/robot-arm-testing/), which discusses using robotic arms for impact simulations.

These tests align with automotive standards like SAE J586 for headlamps and ISO standards for lighting, ensuring compliance and reliability. The selection of these tests is based on their prevalence in industry practices, as evidenced by resources like [Headlights | IIHS](https://www.iihs.org/topics/headlights), which evaluates headlight performance for safety.

#### Detailed Analysis of Robotic System Design

To automate these tests and reduce the need for human operators on site full-time, a robotic system is proposed. The system would handle the headlight prototype, position it for each test, and collect data, with the Siemens S7 200 PLC coordinating the sequence. The following design considerations are made:

##### Robotic Arm Selection

Given the headlight prototype’s likely size and weight (typically a few kilograms), a small to medium-sized robotic arm is suitable. Options include:

- **Universal Robots UR3**: With a 3 kg payload and 500 mm reach, it’s ideal for laboratory testing, as noted in [Robotic Arms & Grippers | RobotShop](https://www.robotshop.com/collections/robotic-arms), which lists it for automation and research. Its collaborative nature reduces safety concerns, allowing operation without constant human supervision.

- **xArm6 by Ufactory**: Another option, with similar capabilities, mentioned in [Robotic Arms: xArm6, UR5e or PF400? - user experience & feedback from laboratories | Lab Automation Forums](https://labautomation.io/t/robotic-arms-xarm6-ur5e-or-pf400-user-experience-feedback-from-laboratories/1176), suitable for lab environments.

These arms can handle pick-and-place tasks, positioning the headlight for testing, and are designed for precision, which is crucial for photometric and mechanical tests.

##### Test Stations and Automation

Each test type requires a specific station:

- **Photometric Testing Station**: Equipped with a goniophotometer or similar device to measure light output, with the robotic arm positioning the headlight for measurement.

- **Thermal Cycling Station**: A temperature chamber (e.g., -40°C to 85°C) where the robotic arm places the headlight for the duration of the test, then retrieves it.

- **Vibration Testing Station**: A vibration table simulating vehicle vibrations, with the robotic arm mounting and dismounting the headlight.

- **Humidity Testing Station**: A humidity chamber for exposure, with similar robotic handling.

- **Electrical Testing Station**: Automated test equipment for electrical measurements, with the robotic arm connecting and disconnecting the headlight.

- **Crash Testing Station**: A mechanism to simulate impacts, with the robotic arm positioning the headlight for testing.

The robotic arm would move the headlight between these stations according to the test sequence, programmed via its controller. The control system must ensure proper sequencing, with safety interlocks to prevent damage.

##### Integration with Siemens S7 200 PLC

The Siemens S7 200 PLC, an entry-level compact PLC, is used in the user’s standard automation system. From [SIMATIC S7-200 SMART - Siemens IN](https://www.siemens.com/in/en/products/automation/systems/industrial/plc/simatic-s7-200-smart.html), it has limited I/O points (up to 60) and is designed for small applications. Given this, it may not directly control the robotic arm, which typically has its own controller (e.g., UR3 uses a separate control box with Ethernet communication).

Thus, the PLC would act as a supervisor, coordinating the sequence of tests by communicating with:

- The robotic arm’s controller via Modbus over Ethernet, sending high-level commands like “pick up headlight” or “place in chamber X.”

- Test chamber controllers or directly controlling simple test equipment if possible, using digital I/O for start/stop signals.

This setup is feasible, as the S7 200 supports Ethernet communication, as noted in [Siemens SIMATIC S7-200 - PLC-City](https://www.plc-city.com/shop/es/siemens-simatic-s7-200.html), which mentions OPC server support for communication.

##### Automation Benefits

Automating with a robotic system reduces human presence, allowing tests to run continuously without full-time operators. This is particularly beneficial for long-duration tests like thermal cycling, as noted in [Laboratory robotics - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_robotics), which discusses robotic arms for repetitive tasks in labs.

#### Detailed Analysis of WinCC Touchscreen Interface Design

The user wants an intuitive WinCC touchscreen interface for controlling and monitoring the testing process, integrated into their TIA platform. WinCC is a SCADA system from Siemens, and TIA Portal is the unified engineering framework for Siemens automation products.

##### Interface Design

The interface should be user-friendly, with clear navigation and controls suitable for touchscreen operation. Proposed screens include:

- **Main Screen**: Welcome page with options to start a new test, view test history, or configure settings. This provides an entry point for operators.

- **Test Selection Screen**: Allows selection of specific tests (photometric, thermal, vibration, etc.) and their sequence. This could have checkboxes or buttons for each test, with a drag-and-drop interface for ordering, ensuring intuitiveness.

- **Test Monitoring Screen**: Displays current test status (e.g., “Running thermal cycle test”), progress bar, and relevant data (e.g., current temperature, vibration level). This screen should update in real-time, showing live data from the PLC.

- **Results Screen**: Shows results of completed tests, with pass/fail indicators and detailed data (e.g., light intensity measurements, temperature logs). This could include graphs for trends, enhancing usability.

- **Control Panel**: Buttons to start, stop, pause, or resume the testing process, with safety interlocks (e.g., cannot start if robotic arm is in unsafe position).

The interface should have large, clearly labeled buttons and minimal text for touchscreen use, ensuring operators can interact easily without training, as noted in [How Consumer Reports Tests Car Headlights | Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/headlights/how-consumer-reports-tests-car-headlights/), which emphasizes user-friendly testing interfaces.

##### Integration with TIA Platform

Integration involves using TIA Portal to configure both the PLC and WinCC. Steps include:

- **PLC Configuration**: In TIA Portal, configure the S7 200 PLC, defining I/O modules and Ethernet communication settings. From [Siemens S7-200/300/400 - FACTORY I/O](https://docs.factoryio.com/manual/drivers/s7-200-300-400/), it supports Ethernet for data exchange.

- **WinCC Project Setup**: Create a WinCC project within TIA Portal, designing the screens as described. Set up communication with the PLC via Ethernet, using the appropriate driver (e.g., OPC UA or Modbus TCP).

- **Data Point Definition**: Define tags in WinCC that map to PLC memory addresses, such as inputs for test status and outputs for control commands. This ensures real-time data exchange, as noted in [Compatible with S7-200 SMART Programmable PLC Controllers | Lollette](https://www.lollette.com/siemens-s7-200-smart-plc-compatible-controllers).

- **System Deployment**: Download the PLC configuration to the device and set up WinCC runtime on a touchscreen HMI or PC, ensuring seamless operation.

This integration allows operators to control and monitor tests remotely, reducing the need for on-site presence, which is an unexpected benefit for operational efficiency.
