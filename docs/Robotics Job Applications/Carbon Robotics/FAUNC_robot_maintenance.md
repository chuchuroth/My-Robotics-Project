Let’s dive into the second task from your job description: *"Transfer experience and knowledge to maintenance team on sustaining Fanuc Robots and other multiple automation components and elements."* Since you’re coming from a background with hobby-level robotic arms (Arduino-based and your BCN3D Moveo), and you’ve got no experience with FANUC systems, I’ll break this down by comparing your hobby robots to industrial FANUC robots, filling in the knowledge gap, and then covering some must-know basics of preventive maintenance for FANUC systems. This will help you see where your skills align and what you’ll need to learn to tackle this task effectively.

### Differences Between Hobby-Level Robots (Arduino, BCN3D Moveo) and Industrial FANUC Robots

Your experience with Arduino-based arms and the BCN3D Moveo gives you a solid foundation in robotics concepts like motion control, programming, and assembly. However, industrial FANUC robots are a different beast, built for high-stakes production environments. Here’s a detailed comparison to highlight the leap you’re making:

#### 1. Purpose and Application
- **Hobby-Level (Arduino, BCN3D Moveo)**:
  - **Purpose**: Education, prototyping, or personal projects. The BCN3D Moveo, a 5-DOF 3D-printed arm, is designed for learning and low-cost experimentation.
  - **Application**: Small-scale tasks (e.g., picking up lightweight objects <500g, simple demos). Max payload for Moveo is around 0.5-1 kg, and reach is ~0.5 meters.
  - **Environment**: Controlled, low-risk settings like a workshop or classroom.
- **FANUC Robots**:
  - **Purpose**: Heavy-duty, repetitive tasks in manufacturing (e.g., automotive assembly, material handling).
  - **Application**: Processes like pick-and-place (up to 2300 kg payload for models like M-2000iA), welding, or palletizing, with reach up to 4+ meters.
  - **Environment**: Harsh, 24/7 factory floors with dust, vibration, and strict uptime demands.

- **Knowledge Gap**: Your hobby arms focus on flexibility and experimentation; FANUC systems prioritize reliability, precision, and scalability. You’ll need to shift from “making it work” to “keeping it running flawlessly” under industrial pressures.

#### 2. Hardware and Build Quality
- **Hobby-Level**:
  - **Components**: Stepper motors (e.g., NEMA 17 on Moveo), 3D-printed PLA/ABS parts, Arduino Mega or similar microcontrollers, basic sensors (e.g., limit switches).
  - **Durability**: Lightweight and fragile—Moveo’s plastic joints wear out with heavy use or misalignment.
  - **Power**: Low-voltage DC (5-24V), limited torque (~1-5 Nm for Moveo).
- **FANUC Robots**:
  - **Components**: Servo motors with high torque (up to hundreds of Nm), cast metal frames, industrial-grade controllers (e.g., R-30iB), precision encoders.
  - **Durability**: Built to last millions of cycles; an LR Mate 200iD might handle 10,000+ hours before major wear.
  - **Power**: High-voltage AC (200-480V), delivering consistent power for heavy loads.

- **Knowledge Gap**: You’re used to tinkering with off-the-shelf or DIY parts. FANUC systems use proprietary, robust hardware requiring specific tools (e.g., grease guns, torque wrenches) and an understanding of industrial-grade mechanics.

#### 3. Control Systems and Programming
- **Hobby-Level**:
  - **Control**: Open-source Arduino firmware (e.g., Marlin for Moveo), often G-code or basic C sketches. Real-time control is limited by processing power (~16 MHz on Mega).
  - **Programming**: Flexible but manual—your Moveo might use serial commands or ROS if you’ve hacked it that way.
  - **Feedback**: Basic or none (e.g., open-loop steppers unless you added encoders).
- **FANUC Robots**:
  - **Control**: Proprietary real-time OS in the controller, handling 6+ axes with millisecond precision. Servo feedback ensures exact positioning.
  - **Programming**: TP (simple motion scripts) and Karel (structured logic), both FANUC-specific. No G-code—motion is position-based (e.g., `L P[1] 500mm/sec FINE`).
  - **Feedback**: Closed-loop control with encoders, safety interlocks, and I/O integration (e.g., PLCs).

- **Knowledge Gap**: You’ll need to learn FANUC’s ecosystem—TP for quick tasks, Karel for logic—and how to interface with industrial I/O (e.g., 24V digital signals vs. Arduino’s 5V). Real-time determinism replaces Arduino’s “good enough” timing.

#### 4. Scale and Complexity
- **Hobby-Level**: Single-arm projects with 4-5 DOF, minimal external integration (maybe a button or sensor).
- **FANUC Robots**: Multi-axis systems (6+ DOF) integrated into production lines with conveyors, vision systems, and safety guards. A single FANUC might coordinate with PLCs, HMIs, and other robots.

- **Knowledge Gap**: You’ll need systems-level thinking—how the robot fits into a larger automation network—beyond standalone hobby projects.

#### 5. Maintenance and Safety
- **Hobby-Level**: Maintenance is ad hoc—replace a broken 3D-printed part or reflash the Arduino. Safety is minimal (low power, no standards).
- **FANUC Robots**: Structured maintenance (e.g., grease changes every 3850 hours) and strict safety compliance (e.g., ISO 13849, emergency stops, guarding).

- **Knowledge Gap**: Industrial maintenance is proactive and documented, not reactive. Safety standards will be new territory compared to hobby setups.

### Filling the Knowledge Gap

To bridge from your hobby experience to FANUC systems for this task:
1. **Learn FANUC Basics**:
   - **Start with TP**: Get comfortable with jogging the robot (using the teach pendant’s Deadman switch) and writing simple motion programs (e.g., `J P[1] 100% FINE`). FANUC’s ROBOGUIDE software (a simulator) is a great sandbox—ask your employer for access.
   - **Explore Karel**: Write a small program (e.g., a counter) to grasp its logic, building on your C-like Arduino skills.
   - **Resources**: FANUC’s online manuals (via their website) or a basic training course (e.g., FANUC’s “HandlingTool” certification).

2. **Understand Industrial Hardware**:
   - Study FANUC mechanical units (e.g., LR Mate vs. M-710iC) and their servo-driven joints. Your Moveo’s steppers are simpler; servos need tuning (e.g., gains) for precision.
   - Learn I/O wiring—FANUC uses 24V signals for grippers or sensors, unlike Arduino’s 5V GPIO.

3. **Shift Mindset**:
   - Focus on reliability (uptime >99%) and teaching others (the maintenance team), not just building cool stuff. Your job is to sustain, not just create.

4. **Practical Next Steps**:
   - Watch YouTube tutorials on FANUC TP programming (search “FANUC Teach Pendant basics”).
   - Study a FANUC maintenance manual (e.g., for an LR Mate 200iD) to see what “sustaining” entails.

### Basic Must-Knows About Preventive Maintenance for FANUC Robots

Since your task involves transferring knowledge to sustain FANUC robots, preventive maintenance (PM) is key. Industrial robots like FANUC’s need regular care to avoid downtime, unlike hobby arms where you might fix things as they break. Here’s what you need to know, with no prior experience assumed:

#### 1. Why Preventive Maintenance Matters
- **Goal**: Keep the robot running smoothly, avoid unexpected failures, and extend its lifespan (10-20 years vs. months for a hobby arm).
- **FANUC Guideline**: PM every 3850 hours (~12 months at 8 hours/day) or as specified in the model’s manual (e.g., M-10iA vs. R-2000iC differs).

#### 2. Key PM Tasks
- **Grease Joints**:
  - **What**: FANUC robots use grease (e.g., Kyodo Yushi VIGOGREASE) to lubricate gears in each axis (J1-J6).
  - **How**: Drain old grease, inject new grease via fittings (check manual for amounts—e.g., 20g for J1 on an LR Mate). Overgreasing can damage seals.
  - **Frequency**: Every 3850 hours or if you hear grinding noises.
  - **Your Gap**: Moveo might not need this; industrial grease guns and specs are new tools to learn.

- **Check Cables and Connectors**:
  - **What**: Inspect power, signal, and teach pendant cables for wear, fraying, or loose plugs.
  - **How**: Visually check, tug gently, and reseat connectors. Replace if damaged (FANUC part numbers like “A660-8018-T-123”).
  - **Frequency**: Monthly or during PM cycles.
  - **Your Gap**: Arduino wiring is simpler; FANUC’s industrial harnesses are beefier and standardized.

- **Backup Controller Data**:
  - **What**: Save programs, settings, and registers (e.g., R[1], P[1]) to a USB or PCMCIA card.
  - **How**: On the pendant, go to `FILE > BACKUP > ALL`, insert media, and save. Label it (e.g., “Line1_2025-03-20”).
  - **Frequency**: Before major PM or software updates.
  - **Your Gap**: Arduino reflashing is similar, but FANUC backups are critical for production recovery.

- **Inspect Mechanical Wear**:
  - **What**: Look for backlash (slop in joints) or unusual vibrations.
  - **How**: Jog each axis slowly (COORD > JOINT mode), listen for clicks, and feel for resistance. Report to a mechanic if off.
  - **Frequency**: During PM or if precision drops.
  - **Your Gap**: Moveo’s wear might mean reprinting; FANUC needs precise diagnosis.

- **Cleanliness**:
  - **What**: Dust or debris (e.g., metal shavings) can clog fans or joints.
  - **How**: Use compressed air (not water!) on the controller and arm, avoiding electronics.
  - **Frequency**: Monthly or as needed in dirty environments.

#### 3. Tools You’ll Need
- Grease gun, torque wrench, multimeter (for I/O checks), FANUC manual (model-specific), and a logbook to track PM dates.

#### 4. Teaching the Maintenance Team
- **Approach**: Break it down like you’re learning it—start with “why” (e.g., grease prevents gear wear), demo “how” (e.g., jog to grease port), and let them try. Use simple terms (e.g., “J1 is the base swivel”).
- **Your Strength**: Your hands-on Arduino/Moveo experience makes you good at explaining practical steps—build on that.

#### 5. Real-Life Example
- Imagine an M-10iA picking car parts. Without PM, grease dries out, J3 seizes mid-cycle, and the line stops for hours (costing thousands). Your PM routine—greasing J3 every 3850 hours—keeps it humming, and you teach the team to spot early wear signs (e.g., a faint whine).

### Connecting to Your Experience
- **Arduino/Moveo**: You’ve swapped a stepper or tightened a bolt reactively. FANUC PM is proactive—scheduled and precise—to avoid failure, not fix it.
- **Knowledge Boost**: Study a FANUC maintenance manual (e.g., LR Mate 200iD’s is online) and practice explaining one task (e.g., greasing) aloud to mimic training the team.

You’ve got a great start with hobby robotics—now it’s about scaling up to industrial rigor. Let me know if you want a deeper dive into any part (e.g., greasing steps or TP for maintenance checks)!
