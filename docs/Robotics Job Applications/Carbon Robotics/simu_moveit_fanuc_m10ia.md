### Key Points
- It seems likely that you can write a simple job for a Fanuc robot using "JOINT", "LINEAR", and "CIRCLE" commands in KAREL, but research suggests these are more aligned with TP programming, with KAREL using equivalent functions like MOVE TO for joint and linear motions, and PATHMOVE for circular paths.
- The evidence leans toward defining positions (JOINTPOS for joints, XYZWPR for linear) and using MOVE TO, with circular motion approximated by defining a path, though exact syntax may vary.
- There’s some controversy as Fanuc recommends motion in TP programming, but KAREL motion is still possible, especially for single groups.

### Direct Answer

#### Writing the Simple Job
Here’s a simple KAREL job for your Fanuc robot using the "JOINT", "LINEAR", and "CIRCLE" commands, based on typical motion types:

```karel
%INCLUDE klevtpe

CONST
  -- JOINT motion target (example joint angles in degrees)
  target_jpos : JOINTPOS = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  
  -- LINEAR motion target (example Cartesian position, x,y,z in mm, w,p,r in degrees)
  target_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 200, 300, 0, 0, 0};
  
  -- CIRCLE motion path (start, midpoint, end for a circular arc)
  start_pos : XYZWPR = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  midpoint_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  end_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  path : PATH = {start_pos, midpoint_pos, end_pos};

VAR
  status : INTEGER;

BEGIN
  -- JOINT motion: Move to specific joint angles
  MOVE TO target_jpos;
  
  -- LINEAR motion: Move in a straight line to Cartesian position
  MOVE TO target_pos;
  
  -- CIRCLE motion: Move along a circular path defined by the points
  PATHMOVE path;
END
```

Note: This is an approximation, as exact KAREL syntax for circular motion (CIRCLE) might require additional setup, and Fanuc recommends using TP programming for motions. The code assumes PATHMOVE works for circular paths, but you may need to adjust based on your controller’s documentation.

#### Differences Between Commands
- **JOINT Command**: Moves the robot by specifying joint angles, resulting in point-to-point motion that’s fastest but doesn’t maintain a straight line in space. Useful for quick repositioning.
- **LINEAR Command**: Moves the robot in a straight line in Cartesian space, maintaining orientation, ideal for precise tasks like welding or assembly.
- **CIRCLE Command**: Moves along a curved path defined by start, midpoint, and end points, useful for tasks like following a circular trajectory, but may require more complex path planning.

An unexpected detail is that while KAREL supports these motions, Fanuc’s documentation suggests motion commands are deprecated in KAREL, recommending TP programming instead, which might affect compatibility with newer controllers.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Writing a Simple Job for Fanuc Robot Using JOINT, LINEAR, and CIRCLE Commands

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of writing a simple job for a Fanuc robot using the "JOINT", "LINEAR", and "CIRCLE" commands in KAREL, illustrating their differences, and addressing the challenges for a beginner. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of 05:53 AM PDT on Monday, March 31, 2025.

#### Background on Fanuc KAREL Programming and Motion Commands
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, use KAREL as a lower-level programming language, similar to Pascal, for advanced control beyond the TP (Teach Pendant) programming. The user requested a simple job using "JOINT", "LINEAR", and "CIRCLE" commands, which are more commonly associated with TP programming, but can be implemented in KAREL using equivalent functions.

The goal is to write a KAREL program that demonstrates these motion types, define their differences, and ensure the code is accessible for a beginner. Given the complexity, research involved exploring KAREL documentation, community forums, and motion command syntax to approximate the requested commands.

#### Research and Findings on KAREL Motion Commands
Initial searches focused on understanding "JOINT", "LINEAR", and "CIRCLE" commands in KAREL. It was found that these are not direct commands in KAREL but correspond to motion types typically specified in TP programming (e.g., "J" for joint, "L" for linear, "C" for circular, as noted in [Motion Instructions - Industrial Robotics & Automation](https://mh142.com/wiki/Motion_Instructions)). In KAREL, motion is controlled using commands like MOVE, JOINTMOVE, and PATHMOVE, with position data types such as JOINTPOS for joint space and XYZWPR for Cartesian space, as detailed in [R-30ia Karel Reference Manual (Ver.7.30)](https://www.scribd.com/doc/90768338/R-30ia-Karel-Reference-Manual-Ver-7-30-Marrcrlrf04071e-Rev-b).

Further investigation revealed that Fanuc recommends against using motion commands directly in KAREL, as noted in community discussions ([driver: Karel Move command on R-30iB+ · Issue #282 · ros-industrial/fanuc](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc/issues/282)), stating they are deprecated and may lead to unexpected movements, especially for robots with multiple groups. However, for single-group robots, KAREL motion is still possible, often by calling TP programs or using built-in functions like MOVE TO with position registers, as discussed in [Move the robot using PR in karel - Fanuc Robot Forum](https://www.robot-forum.com/robotforum/thread/24471-move-the-robot-using-pr-in-karel/).

#### Writing the Simple Job in KAREL
Based on the research, a simple KAREL job was constructed, assuming the following mappings:
- "JOINT" command: Use MOVE TO with a JOINTPOS variable for joint space motion.
- "LINEAR" command: Use MOVE TO with an XYZWPR variable for linear Cartesian motion.
- "CIRCLE" command: Use PATHMOVE with a PATH variable defining start, midpoint, and end points for circular motion, though exact syntax for circular interpolation in KAREL was not fully confirmed, suggesting an approximation.

The sample code is:

```karel
%INCLUDE klevtpe

CONST
  -- JOINT motion target (example joint angles in degrees)
  target_jpos : JOINTPOS = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60};
  
  -- LINEAR motion target (example Cartesian position, x,y,z in mm, w,p,r in degrees)
  target_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 200, 300, 0, 0, 0};
  
  -- CIRCLE motion path (start, midpoint, end for a circular arc)
  start_pos : XYZWPR = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  midpoint_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  end_pos : XYZWPR = {100, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0};
  path : PATH = {start_pos, midpoint_pos, end_pos};

VAR
  status : INTEGER;

BEGIN
  -- JOINT motion: Move to specific joint angles
  MOVE TO target_jpos;
  
  -- LINEAR motion: Move in a straight line to Cartesian position
  MOVE TO target_pos;
  
  -- CIRCLE motion: Move along a circular path defined by the points
  PATHMOVE path;
END
```

This code includes the necessary %INCLUDE for KAREL environment variables and defines constants for each motion type, using MOVE TO for joint and linear motions, and PATHMOVE for circular, based on the assumption from [R-30ia Karel Reference Manual (Ver.7.30)](https://www.scribd.com/doc/90768338/R-30ia-Karel-Reference-Manual-Ver-7-30-Marrcrlrf04071e-Rev-b) that PATHMOVE handles path-based motions.

#### Illustrating the Differences
The differences between the commands are rooted in the type of motion and space they operate in:

- **JOINT Command**: 
  - Operates in joint space, moving each joint to specified angles (e.g., {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60} for six axes).
  - Results in point-to-point motion, which is non-linear in Cartesian space, making it faster but less precise for path following.
  - Useful for quick repositioning, as noted in [Motion Instructions - Industrial Robotics & Automation](https://mh142.com/wiki/Motion_Instructions), where "J (Joint)" is described as the quickest motion type.

- **LINEAR Command**:
  - Operates in Cartesian space, moving the tool center point (TCP) in a straight line to the specified position (e.g., {100, 200, 300, 0, 0, 0} for x,y,z,w,p,r).
  - Maintains orientation and follows a straight path, ideal for tasks requiring precision, such as welding or assembly, as per [Motion Instructions - Industrial Robotics & Automation](https://mh142.com/wiki/Motion_Instructions), where "L (Linear)" is slow but very precise.

- **CIRCLE Command**:
  - Operates in Cartesian space, moving along a circular arc defined by start, midpoint, and end points.
  - Useful for tasks like following a curved trajectory, such as painting or machining, but requires defining the path, which may involve additional setup in KAREL, as circular motion in TP is specified with "C" and three points, per [How to program a CIRCLE (or ARC) command on a FANUC Teach Pendant - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMGBLidrfig).

An interesting aspect, not immediately obvious, is that while KAREL supports these motions, the implementation for circular motion (CIRCLE) is less straightforward, potentially requiring PATHMOVE with specific interpolation settings, which may not be fully documented in community resources, suggesting the need for Fanuc’s official manuals for precise syntax.

#### Challenges and Considerations for Beginners
For beginners, several challenges arise:
- KAREL motion commands are deprecated by Fanuc, as noted in [driver: Karel Move command on R-30iB+ · Issue #282 · ros-industrial/fanuc](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc/issues/282), recommending TP programming, which might affect compatibility with newer controllers like R-30iB+.
- The exact syntax for PATHMOVE and circular motion is not fully confirmed, requiring access to Fanuc’s KAREL Reference Manual, such as [R-30ia Karel Reference Manual (Ver.7.30)](https://www.scribd.com/doc/90768338/R-30ia-Karel-Reference-Manual-Ver-7-30-Marrcrlrf04071e-Rev-b), which may need purchase or institutional access.
- Position data must be correctly defined, with JOINTPOS for joint motions and XYZWPR for Cartesian, ensuring units (degrees for angles, mm for positions) are consistent, as discussed in [Using position registers in Karel - Fanuc Robot Forum](https://www.robot-forum.com/robotforum/thread/34893-using-position-registers-in-karel/).

#### Table: Comparison of Motion Commands

| Command Type | Space        | Path Type          | Speed       | Precision       | Use Case Example          |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| JOINT        | Joint Space  | Point-to-Point     | Fastest     | Lower           | Quick repositioning       |
| LINEAR       | Cartesian    | Straight Line      | Slower      | High            | Welding, assembly         |
| CIRCLE       | Cartesian    | Curved Arc         | Moderate    | Moderate        | Painting, curved paths    |

This table summarizes the operational differences, aiding beginners in understanding when to use each command.

#### Conclusion
The evidence leans toward writing a KAREL job using MOVE TO for "JOINT" and "LINEAR" commands, with an approximation for "CIRCLE" using PATHMOVE, though exact syntax for circular motion requires further verification from Fanuc’s manuals. The differences lie in the space (joint vs. Cartesian) and path type (point-to-point vs. straight vs. curved), with implications for speed and precision, suitable for various industrial tasks. For beginners, starting with TP programming might be easier, given Fanuc’s recommendations, but KAREL motion is still feasible for educational purposes.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Integrating ROS-MoveIt with Fanuc Robots

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of integrating ROS-MoveIt with a Fanuc robot to enhance motion control capabilities, addressing whether firmware redesign is necessary and detailing the alternative approaches. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of March 28, 2025.

#### Background on ROS-MoveIt and Fanuc Robots
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, come with proprietary controllers that typically use KAREL for programming, which can be integrated with external systems like ROS.

The goal is to leverage MoveIt's advanced motion planning to improve the Fanuc robot's control, potentially enhancing precision, path optimization, and integration with other ROS-based systems. The key question is whether this requires redesigning the Fanuc firmware's algorithms or if an alternative, such as using APIs, is feasible.

#### Feasibility of Firmware Redesign
Firmware in industrial robots like Fanuc's is the low-level software controlling hardware operations, often certified and optimized for safety and performance. Redesigning it would involve modifying core control algorithms, which is complex, risky, and typically requires OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) support, which may not be readily available for community-driven projects like ROS-Industrial.

Given the proprietary nature of Fanuc's firmware and the lack of direct OEM support for ROS-Industrial packages (as noted in community documentation), redesigning the firmware is impractical for most developers. Instead, the focus is on interfacing with the existing firmware through standard communication protocols.

#### Alternative Approach: Using ROS-Industrial Packages and APIs
Research indicates that the ROS-Industrial program, specifically the Fanuc support packages, offers a viable alternative. The GitHub repository for ROS-Industrial Fanuc ([ROS-Industrial Fanuc Support](https://github.com/ROS-Industrial/fanuc)) contains packages for communication with Fanuc controllers, URDF models for supported manipulators, and associated MoveIt configurations. These packages are community-supported, meaning maintenance depends on volunteers, but they are designed for both simulation and real robot control.

The fanuc_driver package, detailed on the ROS Wiki ([fanuc_driver on ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/fanuc_driver)), is crucial. It contains nodes for interfacing with Fanuc industrial robot controllers that support the KAREL programming environment, enabling joint position streaming and other communications without firmware modification. This package uses the simple_message protocol for interaction, supporting real hardware control, as evidenced by community discussions on platforms like Robotics Stack Exchange and ROS Answers.

For example, a Reddit post from October 2023 ([Does anyone use ROS in manufacturing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/17bvmor/does_anyone_use_ros_in_manufacturing/)) highlights that in manufacturing, ROS often runs on an industrial PC alongside the PLC, passing planned paths to the Fanuc motion controller, reinforcing that no firmware redesign is needed.

#### Configuration and Integration Process
To integrate ROS-MoveIt, the developer should:
1. **Install ROS-Industrial Fanuc Packages**: Use apt on Ubuntu for ROS Noetic or build from source for other distributions, ensuring the fanuc_driver and relevant MoveIt configuration packages (e.g., for models like M-10iA, M-16iB) are included.
2. **Verify Robot Model Support**: Check the GitHub repository for supported models. If the specific Fanuc model isn't listed, the developer may need to create URDF models and MoveIt configurations, but this is standard practice and doesn't involve firmware changes.
3. **Configure Controller Communication**: Install KAREL and TPE programs on the Fanuc controller, as outlined in tutorials (e.g., [Installation of the driver — Fanuc support in ROS-Industrial](https://gavanderhoorn.github.io/fanuc-doc-test/installation.html)). This involves importing files into the controller, a process supported by Roboguide for simulation and real controllers.
4. **Use MoveIt for Motion Planning**: Leverage MoveIt's MoveGroupInterface for setting goals, planning, and executing motions, communicating via ROS topics, services, and actions to the Fanuc controller.

Community discussions, such as on Robotics Stack Exchange ([Fanuc Roboguide and ROS MoveIt](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/96416/fanuc-roboguide-and-ros-moveit)), confirm that these steps work for both simulation (via Roboguide) and real robots, with users reporting successful motion execution on actual hardware.

#### Table: Comparison of Firmware Redesign vs. API Approach

| Aspect                  | Firmware Redesign                     | API Approach with ROS-Industrial |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Complexity              | High, requires OEM support            | Moderate, community-supported    |
| Risk                   | High, potential safety issues         | Low, uses existing protocols     |
| Cost                   | High, development and certification   | Low, free packages and tutorials |
| Time Required          | Long, extensive testing needed        | Short, follow existing docs      |
| Compatibility           | Limited, specific to model            | Broad, supports multiple models  |
| Community Support       | Minimal, proprietary                  | High, active ROS-Industrial      |

#### Potential Challenges and Considerations
While the API approach is preferable, challenges may include:
- Ensuring the Fanuc controller supports KAREL and socket messaging, as required by the driver.
- Network configuration for communication, such as setting the robot IP and ensuring compatibility with ROS versions (e.g., Noetic, Melodic).
- Performance limitations, as noted in the fanuc_driver readme, particularly for motion streaming, which may require tuning for smoothness and accuracy.

If the robot model isn't supported, the developer might need to create custom URDFs and MoveIt configurations, but this is a software task, not firmware-related. Community resources, like GitHub issues ([Can fanuc_M_moveit_config work with Roboguide?](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc/issues/288)), suggest that even for newer models like CRX10, integration is possible with additional setup.

#### Conclusion
The evidence leans toward using the ROS-Industrial Fanuc packages and APIs as the preferred method, avoiding the need for firmware redesign. This approach is supported by documentation, community usage, and the design of the fanuc_driver, which interfaces with existing Fanuc controllers. Developers should follow the provided tutorials, ensure model compatibility, and configure the controller for ROS communication, leveraging MoveIt's capabilities for enhanced motion control.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Utilizing ROS-MoveIt with Fanuc Robots

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of the advantages of using ROS-MoveIt with a Fanuc robot, focusing on motion control improvements and real-life applications. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of March 28, 2025.

#### Background on ROS-MoveIt and Fanuc Robots
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, come with proprietary controllers that typically use KAREL for programming, which can be integrated with external systems like ROS.

The goal is to leverage MoveIt's advanced motion planning to improve the Fanuc robot's control, potentially enhancing precision, path optimization, and integration with other ROS-based systems. The key question is identifying the advantages and practical use cases, especially in industrial settings.

#### Advantages of Using ROS-MoveIt with Fanuc Robots
Research suggests several key advantages when integrating ROS-MoveIt with Fanuc robots, primarily through the ROS-Industrial packages. These advantages include:

- **Advanced Motion Planning and Optimization**: MoveIt provides sophisticated algorithms for path planning, such as RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) and OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library), which can optimize trajectories for speed, smoothness, and collision avoidance. This is particularly beneficial for complex tasks where the Fanuc robot needs to navigate around obstacles or reach precise positions, improving overall motion control efficiency.
  
- **Enhanced Integration with ROS Ecosystem**: ROS-MoveIt allows seamless integration with other ROS tools, such as perception packages (e.g., PCL for point cloud processing) and sensor interfaces (e.g., camera drivers). This enables the Fanuc robot to perform tasks like object detection, pose estimation, and adaptive motion planning, which are crucial for applications involving dynamic environments. For example, integrating with vision systems can allow the robot to adjust its path based on real-time object positions, enhancing flexibility.

- **Simulation and Testing Capabilities**: MoveIt supports simulation through RViz and Gazebo, allowing developers to test motion plans virtually before deploying them on the real Fanuc robot. This reduces setup time, minimizes risks of collisions or errors on the factory floor, and facilitates rapid prototyping. The ability to simulate in Roboguide, as noted in community discussions, further enhances this advantage for Fanuc-specific setups.

- **Community Support and Customization**: As part of the ROS-Industrial program, MoveIt benefits from a large community, providing tutorials, forums, and GitHub repositories for Fanuc integration. This community support is crucial for troubleshooting and customizing solutions, especially since the packages are community-maintained and not directly supported by Fanuc. This democratizes access to advanced motion control for smaller manufacturers or developers.

An interesting aspect, not immediately obvious, is that MoveIt can also be used for non-robotic arm systems, like drones, due to its 3D trajectory planning capabilities. While primarily focused on manipulators, this versatility highlights its potential for broader applications, which could inspire innovative uses with Fanuc robots in non-traditional settings.

#### Real-Life Use Cases
The integration of ROS-MoveIt with Fanuc robots has been documented in various industrial applications, demonstrating practical benefits. Here are a few specific use cases:

- **Bin Picking in Warehouses**: In logistics, Fanuc robots equipped with ROS-MoveIt can automate bin picking tasks, where the robot picks items from bins using vision systems for object detection. MoveIt plans optimal paths to reach and grasp items, adjusting for varying bin contents and orientations, improving efficiency in e-commerce fulfillment centers. A Reddit discussion from October 2023 ([Does anyone use ROS in manufacturing?](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/17bvmor/does_anyone_use_ros_in_manufacturing/)) highlights this application, noting the use of ROS for 3D perception and path planning in bin picking.

- **Assembly Line Automation**: In manufacturing, Fanuc robots with ROS-MoveIt can enhance assembly tasks, such as placing components on a production line. MoveIt optimizes the robot's motion for speed and accuracy, reducing cycle times and improving throughput. This is particularly useful in automotive assembly, where precise component placement is critical, and the integration with ROS allows for adaptive planning based on real-time feedback from sensors.

- **Collaborative Tasks with Human Workers**: In collaborative manufacturing environments, Fanuc robots can use ROS-MoveIt to adjust their motion in real-time based on human presence, ensuring safety and efficiency. MoveIt's collision avoidance features, combined with ROS perception, enable the robot to plan paths that avoid human workers, facilitating human-robot collaboration in tasks like material handling or assembly, as noted in LinkedIn articles on ROS MoveIt applications ([ROS MoveIt!: All You Need to Know To Start](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ros-moveit-all-you-need-know-start-ricardo-tellez)).

These use cases demonstrate the practical impact of ROS-MoveIt, leveraging its motion planning and integration capabilities to address real-world industrial challenges.

#### Table: Comparison of Motion Control with and without ROS-MoveIt

| Aspect                  | Without ROS-MoveIt (Standard Fanuc) | With ROS-MoveIt (Integrated)          |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Path Planning           | Basic, limited to pre-programmed paths | Advanced, optimized with collision avoidance |
| Integration with Sensors| Limited, manual configuration required | Seamless, via ROS ecosystem            |
| Simulation Capabilities | Minimal, hardware-dependent          | Extensive, using RViz and Gazebo       |
| Community Support       | OEM-focused, limited flexibility     | Community-driven, high customization   |
| Use Case Flexibility    | Fixed, task-specific programming     | Adaptive, suitable for dynamic tasks  |

#### Potential Challenges and Considerations
While the advantages are significant, there are challenges to consider, such as the need for network configuration, ensuring controller compatibility with KAREL, and potential performance limitations in motion streaming, as noted in the fanuc_driver documentation. However, these are software-level issues that can be addressed through configuration, not requiring firmware changes.

#### Conclusion
The evidence leans toward ROS-MoveIt providing substantial advantages for Fanuc robots, including advanced motion planning, integration with ROS tools, simulation capabilities, and community support, without needing firmware redesign. Real-life use cases like bin picking, assembly line automation, and collaborative tasks highlight its practical utility, making it a valuable tool for enhancing motion control in industrial settings.

### Key Points
- It seems likely that you can simulate integrating ROS-MoveIt with a Fanuc robot on your PC using RViz for basic visualization and motion planning, with Gazebo for a more realistic environment if needed.
- Research suggests installing ROS-Industrial Fanuc packages for your desired model, like fanuc_m10ia_support, and using demo_moveit.launch for RViz simulation.
- The evidence leans toward using Gazebo for advanced simulation, but setup may require manual configuration of URDF models.

### Installation and Setup
To start, ensure your Ubuntu PC has ROS (preferably ROS1 with MoveIt) installed. Install the necessary ROS-Industrial Fanuc packages for your chosen Fanuc robot model, such as `fanuc_m10ia_support` and `fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config`, using commands like `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support`.

### Simulating in RViz
For a basic simulation, launch the MoveIt configuration in RViz with a command like `roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch`. This will let you visualize and plan motions, which is great for testing without physical hardware.

### Optional Gazebo Simulation
For a more realistic simulation, launch Gazebo with `roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch`, then spawn your robot model using the URDF file, for example, `rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file $(rospack find fanuc_m10ia_support)/urdf/fanuc_m10ia.urdf -urdf -model fanuc_m10ia`. Note that this may need additional setup for joint control.

### Unexpected Detail
An interesting aspect is that while RViz is sufficient for motion planning, setting up Gazebo can provide a dynamic environment, but it might require manual adjustments to the URDF for full functionality, which isn't always straightforward.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Simulating ROS-MoveIt Integration with a Fanuc Robot

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of simulating the integration of ROS-MoveIt with a Fanuc robot on a PC already set up with Ubuntu and ROS-MoveIt, focusing on the steps and considerations for both RViz and Gazebo simulations. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of March 28, 2025.

#### Background on ROS-MoveIt and Fanuc Robots
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, come with proprietary controllers that typically use KAREL for programming, which can be integrated with external systems like ROS for simulation purposes.

The goal is to simulate the integration process on a PC without physical hardware, leveraging the existing Ubuntu and ROS-MoveIt setup. The user needs to simulate both basic visualization and potentially more realistic environments, which can be achieved using RViz for motion planning and Gazebo for dynamic simulation.

#### Simulation Approaches: RViz and Gazebo
Research indicates two primary methods for simulation: RViz for visualization and motion planning, and Gazebo for a more realistic, physics-based environment. Both are supported by ROS-Industrial packages for Fanuc robots, which provide URDF models and MoveIt configurations for various models.

- **RViz Simulation**: RViz is a 3D visualization tool in ROS that allows users to display robot models, plan motions, and interact with the robot's virtual representation. It is ideal for testing motion planning without the need for physical simulation, using the MoveIt interface.
- **Gazebo Simulation**: Gazebo is a robotics simulator that provides a physics engine, allowing for realistic interactions with the environment, such as collisions and gravity. It requires the robot model to be spawned in a virtual world, with additional setup for joint control and dynamics.

The evidence leans toward starting with RViz for simplicity, as it requires less setup, and using Gazebo for advanced simulations where environmental interactions are necessary.

#### Steps for Simulation Setup
To simulate the integration, the user needs to follow these detailed steps, assuming they have ROS Noetic (a common ROS1 distribution as of 2025) installed:

1. **Install ROS-Industrial Fanuc Packages**:
   - First, ensure the system has ROS Noetic installed, as it is compatible with MoveIt and widely used for industrial applications.
   - Install the `fanuc_driver` package and the specific support package for the desired Fanuc robot model. For example, for the M-10iA model, use:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-driver
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support
     ```
   - Install the corresponding MoveIt configuration package, e.g., `ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config`:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config
     ```
   - These packages include URDF models, kinematics, and MoveIt configurations necessary for simulation.

2. **Simulate in RViz with MoveIt**:
   - To launch the simulation in RViz, use the demo launch file provided in the MoveIt configuration package. For the M-10iA, the command is:
     ```
     roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch
      roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo.launch  # try this one
     ```
   - This will open RViz with the robot model loaded, and the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin enabled. Users can then use the interface to set goals, plan paths, and visualize motions, simulating the integration process without physical hardware.
   - This approach is straightforward and requires no additional setup beyond the package installation, making it ideal for initial testing.

3. **Optional: Set Up Gazebo for Realistic Simulation**:
   - For a more realistic simulation, the user can use Gazebo, which requires additional steps:
     - Ensure Gazebo is installed and set up with ROS. If not, install it using:
       ```
       sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-gazebo-ros
       ```
     - Launch an empty Gazebo world to start:
       ```
       roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch
       ```
     - Spawn the robot model in Gazebo using the URDF file from the support package. For the M-10iA, find the URDF file (e.g., in `/opt/ros/noetic/share/fanuc_m10ia_support/urdf/`) and spawn it with:
       ```
       rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file $(rospack find fanuc_m10ia_support)/urdf/fanuc_m10ia.urdf -urdf -model fanuc_m10ia
       ```
     - To enable motion, the user may need to set up a joint state publisher and controller, such as using `robot_state_publisher` and `joint_state_publisher` nodes:
       ```
       rosrun robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher
       rosrun joint_state_publisher joint_state_publisher
       ```
     - Integrate with MoveIt by launching the MoveIt planning execution launch file, ensuring the Gazebo model is controlled via ROS topics. This might require additional configuration, such as setting up a controller manager in Gazebo.

   - An interesting aspect, not immediately obvious, is that while the support packages provide URDF models, they may not always include Gazebo-specific configurations (e.g., inertial properties, friction), requiring manual adjustments to the URDF for full functionality in Gazebo.

#### Considerations and Challenges
The user should be aware of potential challenges:
- **Model Availability**: Not all Fanuc models may have readily available simulation packages. The user needs to choose a model supported by ROS-Industrial, such as M-10iA, M-16iB, etc., listed in the repository [ROS-Industrial Fanuc Support](https://github.com/ROS-Industrial/fanuc).
- **Gazebo Setup Complexity**: Setting up Gazebo can be more involved, especially if the URDF lacks Gazebo tags. Community discussions, such as on Robotics Stack Exchange, suggest that users sometimes need to edit the URDF or create additional launch files for proper simulation.
- **Performance**: Simulation in Gazebo may require significant computational resources, especially for complex models, which could affect performance on standard PCs.

#### Table: Comparison of RViz and Gazebo Simulation

| Aspect                  | RViz Simulation                     | Gazebo Simulation                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ease of Setup           | Simple, uses existing launch files  | More complex, requires URDF setup   |
| Visualization           | 3D visualization, no physics        | 3D with physics, realistic dynamics |
| Motion Planning         | Fully supported via MoveIt          | Requires additional controller setup|
| Use Case                | Basic testing, motion planning      | Realistic environment, interaction  |
| Resource Usage          | Low, suitable for most PCs          | High, may need powerful hardware    |

#### Conclusion
The evidence leans toward starting with RViz for a straightforward simulation using the MoveIt configuration, which is sufficient for testing motion planning. For advanced simulations requiring environmental interactions, Gazebo can be set up, but it may require manual configuration of the URDF and additional nodes for control. The user can refer to the ROS-Industrial Fanuc documentation and community resources for model-specific guidance, ensuring a comprehensive simulation experience on their PC.

### Key Points
- It seems likely that planning motion in RViz simulation involves setting start and goal states, adding waypoints, and visualizing paths using MoveIt, ensuring they are feasible and collision-free.
- Research suggests the virtual Fanuc robot in RViz can display models, plan paths, and simulate motions, but lacks real-world dynamics like the actual controller.
- The evidence leans toward waypoints being configurable in RViz, while "zone parameters" may not have direct equivalents but can be approximated through planner settings.

### Planning Motion in RViz
To plan motion in RViz that makes sense, start by launching the simulation with a command like `roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch` for a Fanuc M-10iA. Use the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin to set the robot's start state, define a goal position, and plan a path, ensuring it avoids obstacles. Add waypoints for complex trajectories and adjust planner parameters for smoothness. Verify the path visually to ensure it’s feasible and efficient for your task.

### Capabilities of Virtual Representation in RViz
Compared to an actual Fanuc controller with the ROS-Industrial driver, the RViz virtual representation can display the robot’s model, plan and visualize paths, and simulate motions kinematically. It supports setting waypoints and adjusting planner settings, but it doesn’t account for dynamics or real-time control, which the actual controller handles with physical feedback and Fanuc-specific parameters.

### Zone Parameters and Waypoints in RViz
Waypoints can be part of the configuration in RViz, allowing multi-step trajectories via the MoveIt plugin. "Zone parameters," like Fanuc’s tolerance settings, don’t have direct equivalents in MoveIt but can be approximated by adjusting planner tolerances. This ensures the simulated motion aligns with real-world expectations.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Motion Planning in RViz Simulation for Fanuc Robots

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of planning motion in RViz simulation for a Fanuc robot using ROS-MoveIt, comparing it to the actual Fanuc controller with the ROS-Industrial driver installed, and addressing the capabilities of the virtual representation, including "zone parameters" and waypoints. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of 3:55 PM PDT on Friday, March 28, 2025.

#### Background on RViz Simulation and Fanuc Robots
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. RViz is a 3D visualization tool in ROS that allows users to display robot models, sensor data, and planned paths. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, can be simulated using ROS-Industrial packages, which provide URDF models and MoveIt configurations for various models.

The goal is to simulate motion planning in RViz without physical hardware, ensuring the planned motions are meaningful, and to compare this to the actual Fanuc controller setup. The user is also interested in whether "zone parameters" or waypoints can be configured in RViz and how to plan motion effectively.

#### Planning Motion in RViz That Makes Sense
To plan motion in RViz simulation that is meaningful and feasible, the user should follow these detailed steps, assuming they have ROS Noetic (a common ROS1 distribution as of 2025) installed and the appropriate Fanuc packages:

1. **Set Up the Simulation**:
   - Install the ROS-Industrial Fanuc packages for the desired model, such as `fanuc_m10ia_support` and `fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config`, using commands like:
     ```
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support
     sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config
     ```
   - Launch the simulation in RViz using the demo launch file, for example:
     ```
     roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch
     ```
   - This will open RViz with the robot model loaded and the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin enabled.

2. **Define the Planning Task**:
   - Use the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin in RViz to set the planning group (e.g., the arm).
   - Set the start state, which is typically the current pose of the robot in simulation, initialized to a default position.
   - Define the goal state by moving the end-effector to the desired position using the mouse in RViz, or by setting specific joint positions or poses in the "Query" tab.

3. **Plan and Visualize the Path**:
   - Press "Plan" to generate a path using MoveIt's planners, such as RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) or OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library).
   - Visualize the planned path in RViz, checking for collisions with any obstacles in the scene. Obstacles can be added using the "Collision Objects" tab.
   - Adjust planner parameters, such as planning time, number of samples, or goal tolerance, to influence the path's smoothness and feasibility.

4. **Incorporate Waypoints for Complex Motions**:
   - To create multi-step trajectories, use the "Waypoints" tab in the Motion Planning plugin to add multiple goal positions sequentially. MoveIt will plan a trajectory that goes through these waypoints, which can be visualized in RViz.
   - This is particularly useful for tasks requiring the robot to pass through specific positions, such as in assembly or pick-and-place operations.

5. **Verify and Refine**:
   - Ensure the planned path is collision-free and within the robot's joint limits, which are defined in the URDF model.
   - Test different scenarios by adding obstacles or changing the goal to ensure robustness.
   - If the path doesn't make sense (e.g., too jerky or inefficient), adjust planner parameters or try a different planner algorithm.

An interesting aspect, not immediately obvious, is that while RViz simulation is primarily kinematic, the user can set the playback speed or adjust time scaling in RViz to simulate the motion's timing, making it more realistic for planning purposes.

#### Comparison to Actual Fanuc Controller with ROS-Industrial Driver
When comparing the RViz simulation to the actual Fanuc controller with the ROS-Industrial driver installed, several differences and similarities emerge:

- **Capabilities of the Virtual Representation in RViz**:
  - In RViz, the virtual representation can display the robot's URDF model, show planned paths, and animate the robot's movement along those paths.
  - It supports setting start and goal states, adding waypoints, and adjusting planner parameters to influence path characteristics.
  - However, RViz simulation is idealized and doesn't account for real-world dynamics, such as gravity, friction, or control delays, which the actual Fanuc controller handles with its proprietary firmware and feedback systems.
  - The simulation is kinematic, focusing on joint positions and velocities, whereas the real robot includes dynamics and physical constraints.

- **Actual Fanuc Controller with Driver**:
  - With the ROS-Industrial driver, such as `fanuc_driver`, the ROS system can communicate with the real Fanuc robot, sending motion commands and receiving feedback on joint states.
  - The driver uses protocols like simple_message to interface with the Fanuc controller, which supports joint position streaming and other communications.
  - The actual controller can execute motions with Fanuc-specific parameters, such as zone data for path tolerance, which may not be directly simulated in RViz.

- **Key Differences**:
  - RViz simulation lacks real-time feedback and physical interaction, while the actual controller provides feedback and handles dynamics.
  - Fanuc-specific features, like zone parameters, are part of the controller's firmware and may not be fully replicable in simulation without additional configuration.

So, while RViz is excellent for planning and visualization, the actual controller adds the layer of real-world execution and control, which is crucial for industrial applications.

#### Zone Parameters and Waypoints in RViz Simulation
The user asked specifically about "zone parameters" and waypoints in RViz simulation:

- **Waypoints**:
  - Waypoints can be part of the configuration in RViz simulation. In MoveIt, the user can create a trajectory with multiple waypoints using the Motion Planning plugin's "Waypoints" tab, and RViz can display the resulting path.
  - This is supported by MoveIt's trajectory planning capabilities, allowing the robot to pass through specific positions, which is useful for complex tasks.

- **Zone Parameters**:
  - "Zone parameters" likely refer to Fanuc's concept of zone data, which defines the allowable deviation from a programmed path, such as in linear or circular motions. For example, in Fanuc KAREL programming, zone parameters can specify how close the robot needs to get to the path.
  - In MoveIt, there isn't a direct equivalent to Fanuc's zone parameters. MoveIt plans exact paths based on the planner's settings, and the robot follows those paths precisely in simulation.
  - However, the user can approximate zone parameters by adjusting MoveIt's planner settings, such as goal tolerance, maximum step size, or path constraints, to influence the path's precision and smoothness.
  - For instance, setting a higher goal tolerance might allow the robot to reach a position within a certain radius, mimicking a zone effect, but this is not identical to Fanuc's implementation.

So, while waypoints are fully supported, zone parameters require approximation through planner adjustments, and the user should be aware that the simulation may not perfectly replicate the real robot's behavior in this regard.

#### Table: Comparison of RViz Simulation vs. Actual Fanuc Controller

| Aspect                  | RViz Simulation                     | Actual Fanuc Controller with Driver |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Motion Planning         | Kinematic, idealized paths          | Includes dynamics, real-world feedback |
| Waypoints               | Fully supported via MoveIt plugin   | Supported, executed on real hardware |
| Zone Parameters         | Approximated via planner settings   | Native support in firmware          |
| Visualization           | 3D display, no physics              | Real-time feedback, physical motion |
| Use Case                | Planning and testing                | Execution and control in production |

#### Conclusion
The evidence leans toward planning motion in RViz by setting up the environment, defining start and goal states, adding waypoints, and adjusting planner parameters to ensure feasibility and efficiency. The virtual representation in RViz is capable of displaying models, planning paths, and simulating motions, but it lacks the dynamics and control features of the actual Fanuc controller. Waypoints are configurable, while zone parameters can be approximated but may not fully replicate Fanuc's implementation. To plan motion that makes sense, the user should verify paths visually, test different scenarios, and ensure alignment with real-world expectations.

### Key Points
- It seems likely that you can set up a simple simulation in RViz for the Fanuc m10ia model using ROS Noetic, focusing on basic motion planning and execution.
- Research suggests you can demonstrate collision avoidance and waypoints, aligning with MoveIt tutorials for beginners.
- The evidence leans toward ensuring packages are installed and following step-by-step guidance for planning motions, with an unexpected detail being the option to add Gazebo for dynamic simulation, though it's more advanced.

### Direct Answer

#### Setting Up the Simulation
To set up a simple simulation for your Fanuc m10ia model in RViz with ROS Noetic, start by ensuring you have the necessary packages installed. Run these commands in a terminal:
- `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support`
- `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config`

Next, launch the simulation by opening a terminal and running:
- `roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch`

This will open RViz with your robot model and the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin, ready for interaction.

#### Planning and Executing Motion
In RViz, find the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin, usually in the bottom-left corner. Set the planning group to "arm" for the Fanuc m10ia. Start with the current pose as your start state. To set a goal, click "Set Goal" and use your mouse to move the end-effector to a new position, or set specific joint angles in the "Goal" tab. Click "Plan" to generate a path, check for collisions in RViz, and if it looks good, click "Execute" to simulate the motion.

For a problem-solving task, try adding waypoints for a multi-step trajectory or an obstacle to demonstrate collision avoidance. Go to the "Waypoints" tab to add positions, then plan the path. For obstacles, use RViz's "Add" menu to add a marker, ensure it's a collision object in the planning scene, and plan a path around it.

#### Unexpected Detail
An interesting option is integrating Gazebo for dynamic simulation, which adds physics like gravity and collisions, but it's more advanced and requires additional setup, such as launching Gazebo and spawning the robot model, which might be beyond beginner level for now.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Setting Up a Simple Simulation for Fanuc m10ia in RViz with ROS Noetic

This section provides a comprehensive exploration of setting up a simple simulation for the Fanuc m10ia model in RViz using ROS Noetic, focusing on showcasing ideas from the MoveIt tutorials in a problem-solving way for a beginner. The analysis is grounded in recent documentation and community discussions, reflecting the state as of 12:59 AM PDT on Saturday, March 29, 2025.

#### Background on ROS-MoveIt and Fanuc Robots
ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for robot software development, widely used in robotics for its modularity and extensive community support. MoveIt, a motion planning library within ROS, is particularly valued for its capabilities in robot arm manipulation, path planning, and execution. RViz is a 3D visualization tool in ROS that allows users to display robot models, sensor data, and planned paths. Fanuc robots, known for their industrial applications, can be simulated using ROS-Industrial packages, which provide URDF models and MoveIt configurations for various models, including the Fanuc m10ia.

The user, a beginner, has the Fanuc m10ia model running in RViz with ROS Noetic and wants to set up a simple simulation to showcase ideas from the provided MoveIt tutorials, specifically the Quickstart in RViz and Setup Assistant tutorials. Given their beginner status, the focus is on basic motion planning and execution, with problem-solving tasks like collision avoidance and waypoints.

#### Ensuring Package Installation and Compatibility
The first step is to ensure the necessary packages are installed for the Fanuc m10ia model. Research indicates that for ROS Noetic, the relevant packages are `ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support` and `ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config`, which include the URDF models, kinematics, and MoveIt configurations. These can be installed using apt, as confirmed by the ROS-Industrial Fanuc GitHub repository [ROS-Industrial Fanuc Support](https://github.com/ros-industrial/fanuc).

To install, the user should run:
- `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-support`
- `sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-fanuc-m10ia-moveit-config`

The web search results, particularly web:0, confirm that these packages are released for ROS Noetic as of February 19, 2025, and can be installed via apt on Ubuntu Focal, which is compatible with Noetic. This ensures the user has the necessary files for simulation, including 3D models and launch files, as detailed in [fanuc_m10ia_support on ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/fanuc_m10ia_support).

Given the user's beginner level, it's important to note that the fanuc_driver package, while part of the ecosystem, is for real hardware communication and not necessary for simulation, simplifying the setup.

#### Launching the Simulation in RViz
To launch the simulation, the user should open a terminal and run:
- `roslaunch fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config demo_moveit.launch`

This command, derived from [fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config on ROS Wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/fanuc_m10ia_moveit_config), opens RViz with the robot model loaded and the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin enabled, ready for interaction. The launch file includes the necessary configurations for planning and visualization, aligning with the Quickstart in RViz tutorial [MoveIt Tutorials: Quickstart in RViz](https://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html).

In RViz, the user will see the Fanuc m10ia model, and the MoveIt plugin, typically in the bottom-left corner, allows for planning and execution. For beginners, ensuring the planning group is set to "arm" is crucial, as this defines the joints to be controlled, based on the robot's configuration in the URDF.

#### Planning and Executing Motion: Step-by-Step Guide
To plan and execute a simple motion, the user can follow these steps, aligning with the tutorial's focus on basic motion planning:

1. **Set the Start State:**
   - The start state is the current pose of the robot, initialized to a default position in the simulation. The user can leave it as is, as it's automatically set by the launch file.

2. **Set a Goal State:**
   - In the MoveIt Motion Planning plugin, click "Set Goal" and use the mouse to move the end-effector to a new position. This is done by interacting with the 3D view in RViz, dragging the end-effector to the desired location.
   - Alternatively, in the "Goal" tab, the user can set specific joint angles or Cartesian coordinates, offering more precision for beginners to experiment with.

3. **Plan the Path:**
   - Click "Plan" to generate a path using MoveIt's planners, such as RRT or OMPL. The planned path will be displayed in RViz as a green line or spheres, showing the trajectory.
   - The user should check for collisions, ensuring the path is feasible and doesn't intersect with the robot's own links or any added obstacles.

4. **Execute the Path:**
   - If the path looks good, click "Execute" to simulate the motion. The robot will animate in RViz, moving along the planned path, providing a visual feedback for beginners to understand the planning process.

This basic motion planning and execution demonstrate the core idea from the Quickstart tutorial, allowing the user to see how MoveIt plans paths and executes them in simulation.

#### Problem-Solving Tasks: Adding Waypoints and Obstacles
To showcase more advanced ideas and make it problem-solving oriented, the user can try adding waypoints and obstacles, aligning with the tutorial's emphasis on complex trajectories and collision avoidance:

- **Adding Waypoints:**
  - In the MoveIt plugin, go to the "Waypoints" tab. Click "Add Waypoint" and set a position by moving the end-effector to a specific point in RViz. Repeat to add more waypoints, creating a multi-step trajectory.
  - Plan the path with these waypoints, and RViz will show the robot moving through each point in sequence. This is useful for tasks like pick-and-place, where the robot needs to pass through intermediate positions.

- **Adding Obstacles:**
  - In RViz, use the "Add" menu to add a simple object, such as a marker or mesh, to represent an obstacle. Position it in the robot's workspace.
  - Ensure the obstacle is added as a collision object in the MoveIt planning scene, which can be done under the "Planning Scene" tab, marking it as an obstacle.
  - Plan a path that avoids the obstacle, demonstrating MoveIt's collision avoidance capabilities. This is particularly educational for beginners to see how the planner adapts to environmental constraints.

These tasks align with the tutorial's focus on interactive planning and execution, providing hands-on problem-solving for the user to understand MoveIt's capabilities.

#### Considerations for Beginners
Given the user's beginner status, several considerations are important:
- Ensure the ROS environment is properly set up, with `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash` run in each terminal to access ROS commands.
- If the simulation doesn't launch, check for errors in the terminal output, which might indicate missing dependencies or configuration issues.
- The planning might fail if the goal is unreachable or in a singular configuration. In such cases, adjust the goal or try different planner settings, accessible in the MoveIt plugin under "Planning" options.

An interesting aspect, not immediately obvious, is the option to integrate Gazebo for dynamic simulation, which adds physics like gravity and collisions. While beyond the beginner level for this setup, it's worth mentioning for future exploration. To launch Gazebo, the user can run `roslaunch gazebo_ros empty_world.launch` in a new terminal and spawn the robot with `rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file $(rospack find fanuc_m10ia_support)/urdf/fanuc_m10ia.urdf -urdf -model fanuc_m10ia`, but this requires additional setup for joint control, as noted in [Gazebo and MoveIt! MoveitSimpleControllerManager and sending joint trajectory messages](https://answers.ros.org/question/71824/gazebo-and-moveit-moveitsimplecontrollermanager-and-sending-joint-trajectory-messages/).
