### Key Points
- It seems likely that FANUC robots use AC servo motors for precise control, commonly integrated with TP for basic programming and Karel for complex logic.
- Research suggests TP is ideal for simple pick-and-place tasks, using motion commands like L (linear) for precision, while Karel handles advanced features like loops.
- The evidence leans toward combining TP and Karel for tasks needing external input checks, ensuring flexibility in industrial settings.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Programming a FANUC Robot
#### Teaching Positions
Start by using the teach pendant to manually move the robot to the pick-up location (e.g., P[1]) and place location (e.g., P[2]), recording each position into position registers for later use.

#### Writing the TP Program
Create a basic TP program for the pick-and-place task:
- Use **L (Linear motion)** for precise movement, e.g., `L P[1] 100% FINE` to move to the pick position at full speed and stop precisely.
- Add gripper control using digital outputs (DO), e.g., `DO[1]=ON` to close the gripper, with waits like `WAIT 500` for gripper actions.
- Example program:
  ```
  1: L P[1] 100% FINE ;
  2: DO[1]=ON ;
  3: WAIT 500 ;
  4: L P[2] 100% FINE ;
  5: DO[1]=OFF ;
  6: WAIT 500 ;
  ```

#### Adding Loops and Conditions
- For repeating the task (e.g., 10 times), use TP’s label and jump commands:
  - Initialize a counter, e.g., `R[1]=0`.
  - Use `LBL[1]` for the loop start and `JMP LBL[1]` with a condition like `IF R[1]<10`.
  - Example:
    ```
    1: R[1]=0 ;
    2: LBL[1] ;
    3: L P[1] 100% FINE ;
    4: DO[1]=ON ;
    5: WAIT 500 ;
    6: L P[2] 100% FINE ;
    7: DO[1]=OFF ;
    8: WAIT 500 ;
    9: R[1]=R[1]+1 ;
    10: IF R[1]<10, JMP LBL[1] ;
    ```
- For external inputs (e.g., checking if an object is present via DI[1]), add conditions like `IF DI[1]=ON, L P[1] 100% FINE ; ELSE JMP LBL[2]`.

#### Testing and Error Handling
- Test using the teach pendant to step through lines, ensuring movements and I/O work as expected.
- Use FANUC’s ROBOGUIDE for simulation to verify logic without physical movement.
- Handle errors by checking teach pendant error codes and consulting the manual for fixes, ensuring safety by avoiding collisions.

#### Unexpected Detail
Did you know Karel can also manage network communications, like reading data from a vision system, enhancing your program for dynamic environments? This could be useful for adapting to varying object positions.

### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of FANUC Robot Programming for Pick-and-Place Tasks

To address the task of creating a program to control a FANUC robot for picking up an object and placing it elsewhere using TP or Karel, a step-by-step approach is necessary, given the user’s rustiness in FANUC programming. This note provides a comprehensive guide, leveraging the user’s familiarity with basic robotics and programming concepts, and integrates insights from industrial practices.

#### Background on TP and Karel
- **TP (Teach Pendant Language)**: Used for basic programming, it involves defining positions and simple motion commands, suitable for tasks like pick-and-place. It lacks advanced constructs like loops but supports labels and jumps for basic repetition.
- **Karel**: A higher-level language, similar to Pascal, enabling complex logic, loops, conditionals, and integration with external systems. It’s ideal for tasks requiring dynamic decision-making or extensive data handling.

For a simple pick-and-place, TP is sufficient, but for advanced features, combining TP with Karel is recommended, aligning with the user’s task requirements.

#### Step-by-Step Programming Guide

##### 1. Teaching Positions
- **Process**: Use the teach pendant to manually jog the robot to the pick-up location and record it as P[1], then to the place location and record as P[2]. This involves:
  - Selecting the position register (e.g., P[1]) via the pendant.
  - Using jog controls (e.g., COORD mode for Cartesian movement) to position the robot.
  - Pressing the “Record” button to save the position, ensuring no collisions or unreachable points.
- **Safety Consideration**: Ensure the path is clear of obstacles and operators, as safety is paramount in industrial settings.

##### 2. Writing the TP Program for Basic Motion
- **Motion Commands**: 
  - **J (Joint Motion)**: Faster, moves in joint space, less precise for pick-and-place.
  - **L (Linear Motion)**: Moves in a straight line in Cartesian space, ideal for precision, used with speed (e.g., 100%) and termination (e.g., FINE for precise stop).
- **Initial Program**: For a basic pick-and-place:
  ```
  1: L P[1] 100% FINE ;
  2: WAIT 1000 ;  (Simulate pick-up, e.g., 1 second)
  3: L P[2] 100% FINE ;
  4: WAIT 1000 ;  (Simulate place, e.g., 1 second)
  ```
- **Gripper Control**: FANUC robots use digital outputs (DO) for external devices. Update the program to include gripper actions:
  ```
  1: L P[1] 100% FINE ;
  2: DO[1]=ON ;  (Close gripper)
  3: WAIT 500 ;  (Wait 0.5 seconds for gripper to close)
  4: L P[2] 100% FINE ;
  5: DO[1]=OFF ;  (Open gripper)
  6: WAIT 500 ;  (Wait 0.5 seconds for gripper to open)
  ```
- **Reasoning**: Linear motion ensures precision, and waits simulate mechanical actions, aligning with industrial pick-and-place tasks.

##### 3. Adding Loops for Repetition
- **TP Limitation**: No native loops, so use labels and jumps. For 10 cycles:
  ```
  1: R[1]=0 ;  (Initialize cycle count in numeric register R[1])
  2: LBL[1] ;
  3: L P[1] 100% FINE ;
  4: DO[1]=ON ;
  5: WAIT 500 ;
  6: L P[2] 100% FINE ;
  7: DO[1]=OFF ;
  8: WAIT 500 ;
  9: R[1]=R[1]+1 ;  (Increment counter)
  10: IF R[1]<10, JMP LBL[1] ;  (Jump back if less than 10 cycles)
  ```
- **Logic**: R[1] starts at 0, increments after each cycle. After 9 cycles, R[1]=9, jumps back; after 10th cycle, R[1]=10, IF 10<10 is false, stops. This ensures 10 cycles, aligning with repetitive industrial tasks.

##### 4. Handling External Inputs
- **Conditionals in TP**: Use digital inputs (DI) for decisions, e.g., checking if an object is present via DI[1]:
  - Modify line 2: `2: IF DI[1]=ON, L P[1] 100% FINE ; ELSE JMP LBL[2] ;`
  - Add after line 8: `9: LBL[2] ;`
- **Complexity**: For multiple conditions, TP’s label/jump system can get messy. Karel is better for such scenarios, offering WHILE loops and IF-THEN-ELSE, e.g.:
  ```
  PROGRAM pick_place_loop
  VAR
      cycle_count: INTEGER = 0 ;
      max_cycles: INTEGER = 10 ;
  BEGIN
      WHILE cycle_count < max_cycles DO
          IF GET_INPUT(1) = TRUE THEN  (Check DI[1])
              CALL_PROG('pick_place') ;
          ENDIF
          cycle_count = cycle_count + 1 ;
      ENDWHILE
  END pick_place_loop
  ```
- **Recommendation**: For basic tasks, TP suffices; for dynamic inputs, combine with Karel for clarity.

##### 5. Testing and Error Handling
- **Testing**: Use the teach pendant to step through lines, observing movements and I/O. FANUC’s ROBOGUIDE ([FANUC ROBOGUIDE](https://www.fanucamerica.com/products/robotics/robot-simulation-software/roboguide)) allows simulation, verifying logic without physical risk.
- **Error Handling**: FANUC displays error codes on the pendant (e.g., position errors, I/O faults). Refer to the manual for diagnostics, ensuring safety by checking for collisions or unreachable positions.

##### 6. Additional Considerations
- **Robot Model Variations**: Different FANUC models (e.g., LR Mate, M-10iA) may have additional axes or motion types. Check the manual for specifics.
- **System Integration**: For larger systems, Karel can manage communication (e.g., via EtherNet/IP, Profinet) with other machines, ensuring coordination. Example Karel routine for network:
  ```
  ROUTINE read_vision_data
  VAR
      vision_ip: STRING = '192.168.0.100' ;
      vision_port: INTEGER = 5000 ;
      data: STRING ;
  BEGIN
      OPEN_TCP(vision_ip, vision_port) ;
      READ_LINE(data) ;
      CLOSE_TCP() ;
  END read_vision_data
  ```
- **Safety**: Ensure paths avoid human operators, using safety interlocks (e.g., e-stops) as per standards like ISO 13849.

#### Unexpected Detail
Karel’s ability to handle network communications, like reading from a vision system, adds flexibility for dynamic environments, potentially adapting pick positions based on object detection, enhancing industrial applications beyond static tasks.
