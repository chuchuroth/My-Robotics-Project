#### Observations and Insights
- Most books provide GitHub repositories for source code, facilitating hands-on learning, which is unexpected for some academic texts that might rely solely on printed examples. This accessibility enhances practical application, especially for beginners.
- Books without explicit repositories, like "A Systematic Approach to Learning Robot Programming with ROS" and "Robot Operating System (ROS)" by Anis Koubaa, likely include code within the text or through publisher resources, reflecting a traditional approach to technical documentation.
- The variation in repository availability highlights the diversity in publishing practices, with Packt Publishing and O'Reilly Media consistently providing GitHub support, while Springer and independent publishers may rely on book-integrated code.

This survey note ensures a thorough understanding of each book's content and resources, aiding users in selecting appropriate materials for their ROS learning journey.
