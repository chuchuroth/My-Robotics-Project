Autonomous lawn mowers rely on a variety of algorithms to navigate, mow efficiently, avoid obstacles, and adapt to their environment. The complexity of these algorithms varies significantly depending on the mower’s design, target market (budget vs. premium), and technological capabilities as of March 05, 2025. These algorithms range from simple, hard-coded real-time decision-making systems to sophisticated machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, especially in high-end models. Below, I’ll break down the types of algorithms commonly implemented in autonomous lawn mowers, addressing both traditional rule-based systems and advanced ML techniques, and provide examples based on current market trends.

### Types of Algorithms in Autonomous Lawn Mowers

The algorithms in autonomous lawn mowers can be categorized based on their primary functions: navigation and path planning, obstacle avoidance, boundary management, and operational optimization. Here’s a detailed look at each, including whether they’re hard-coded or ML-based:

#### 1. Navigation and Path Planning Algorithms
- **Purpose**: Determine how the mower moves across the lawn to ensure complete coverage with minimal overlap or missed spots.
- **Common Algorithms**:
  - **Random Walk (Hard-Coded)**:
    - **Description**: The mower moves in a straight line until it hits an obstacle or boundary, then turns at a random angle and continues. This is a simple, rule-based approach requiring minimal computation.
    - **Implementation**: Found in entry-level models like Husqvarna Automower 115H and Greenworks Optimow 4. The mower reacts in real-time based on sensor inputs (e.g., bump or boundary wire detection) with pre-programmed rules (e.g., “turn 45° left on collision”).
    - **Advantages**: Low cost, low power, effective for small, simple lawns.
    - **Limitations**: Inefficient for large or complex lawns, leading to uneven coverage.
  - **Systematic Coverage (Rule-Based)**:
    - **Description**: Uses predefined patterns (e.g., stripes, spirals) guided by GPS or boundary wire data. Often employs algorithms like **Boustrophedon path planning** (back-and-forth coverage resembling ox plowing).
    - **Implementation**: Seen in mid-range models like Bosch Indego S+ 500, which maps the lawn and follows a systematic path using boundary wire feedback and wheel odometry.
    - **Advantages**: More efficient than random walk, ensures even coverage.
    - **Limitations**: Requires initial setup (e.g., wire installation) and struggles with dynamic obstacles.
  - **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) (Hybrid)**:

    - **Advantages**: Balances speed and safety, handles dynamic environments better.
    - **Limitations**: Still reactive, not predictive.
  - **Object Detection with ML (Machine Learning)**:
    - **Description**: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or similar ML models to classify obstacles from vision or LiDAR data (e.g., “pet” vs. “rock”) and decide actions (e.g., slow down, detour).
