* **Documentation:**
    * Have the documentation for the language you will be coding in readily available.
    * Use case: quick reference.

**4. Additional Tips:**

* **Test Your Setup:** Before the interview, test your internet connection, camera, microphone, and coding environment.
* **Practice Talking Through Your Code:** Explain your thought process as you code. This is crucial for demonstrating your problem-solving skills.
* **Prepare Questions:** Have thoughtful questions ready to ask the interviewer. This shows your interest and engagement.
* **Stay Calm and Focused:** Take deep breaths, and approach the interview with a positive attitude.

**Key Recommendations:**

* For coding, prioritize Replit or Coderpad.
* For communication, ensure you're comfortable with Zoom or Google Meet.
* For whiteboarding, Excalidraw is a great, simple tool.
* Practice on Leetcode or Hackerrank.

By utilizing these tools and practicing your skills, you'll be well-prepared for your technical interview.
