Below is a detailed analysis of the specified GitHub repositories, focusing on the ROS (Robot Operating System) versions used, any other software frameworks mentioned, and whether a "demo" or "Code in Action" link is provided for laypeople to visualize the code's effects without deploying it themselves. The analysis is based on the provided documentation snippets and additional exploration of each repository's README or structure as of March 15, 2025. If a repository lacks explicit details, reasonable assumptions are made based on context or available metadata.

### Observations

- **ROS Usage**: Most robotics-focused repositories use ROS 1 (Indigo, Kinetic, Melodic) or ROS 2 (Jazzy or unspecified), while IoT repositories typically donâ€™t use ROS, focusing on microcontrollers or cloud platforms.
- **Demo Availability**: Only "Artificial-Intelligence-for-Robotics" provides a "Code in Action" link ([http://bit.ly/2ohcbLg](http://bit.ly/2ohcbLg)). "ROS-Robotics-Projects-SecondEdition" mentions videos but lacks a direct link. Most require deployment for visualization.
- **Non-ROS Software**: IoT projects often use Arduino, AWS, or Python, while ROS projects integrate Gazebo, OpenCV, and TensorFlow for simulation and AI.

For laypeople, the "Code in Action" link in "Artificial-Intelligence-for-Robotics" is the only direct way to visualize effects without setup. Others require running the code in ROS environments like RViz or Gazebo. If you need more details on a specific repository, let me know!
