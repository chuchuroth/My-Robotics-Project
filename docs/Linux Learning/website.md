Given the start-up nature, the website should be manageable to maintain, so the blog can be omitted initially if resources are limited.

#### Platform Selection and Building Process
There are several ways to build the website, considering the user's likely limited resources and technical skills:

1. **Hiring a Web Developer**: This could be expensive, potentially costing several thousand dollars, and may not be feasible for a start-up. It would result in a custom website tailored to needs but requires budgeting.

2. **Using Website Builders**: Services like Wix ([Wix](https://www.wix.com/)), Squarespace ([Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)), or Weebly offer templates and drag-and-drop tools, suitable for beginners. Costs range from free (with limited features) to $10–$40/month for premium plans, including hosting and domain registration.

3. **Using Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Platforms like WordPress ([WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)), Joomla, or Drupal allow more flexibility. WordPress is open-source, with themes like Avada or Astra suitable for tech companies, and hosting costs (e.g., SiteGround, $3–$15/month) plus domain registration ($10–$15/year). It requires some learning but offers customization.

Given the user's technical background in mechatronics, WordPress might be preferable for control, but Wix or Squarespace are easier for quick setup. The choice depends on their comfort with learning web management versus speed of deployment.
