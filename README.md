# 🤖 Robotic Grasping with Deep Learning
🚀 **Author:** Chuchu Xu  
🛠 **Technologies:** Python, ROS 2, TensorFlow, PyBullet  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project implements a **deep reinforcement learning-based robotic grasping** system. The model is trained using the **Cornell Grasp Dataset** and deployed on a simulated robotic arm in PyBullet.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ Train a **YOLO-based grasp detection model** using TensorFlow.  
✅ Simulate robotic grasping in **PyBullet/Gazebo**.  
✅ Real-time **object pose estimation with an RGB-D camera** (Intel RealSense).
